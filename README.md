# Wander_app
# 

A Wander app displays a map by using google Maps with customer styling. 
The app allows the user to get his current location, select the POI, and choose any location with a long click on the screen.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project using Android Studio.
3. Before you run the application, you need a Google Maps API key
    To get one, follow the directions here:

                https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key

             Once you have your API key (it starts with "AIza"), define a new property in your
             project's local.properties file (e.g. MAPS_API_KEY=Aiza...), and replace the
             "YOUR_API_KEY" string in this file with "${MAPS_API_KEY}".
4.Run the application.
